    <h2>Cinnamon Roll Bacon Twists</h2>
    <p>These cinnamon roll bacon twists are sweet, salty, and an easy 'twist' on breakfast rolls. Made with refrigerated cinnamon roll dough, you can use the frosting included to glaze them or as a dip.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>10 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 (5-count) can large cinnamon rolls, such as PillsburyÂ® Grands! Cinnamon Rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until halfway done. 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the skillet and let cool on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Unroll each cinnamon roll and slice each cinnamon roll in half lengthwise to make 2 strips. Lay a slice of bacon on a strip; twist together. Place the twist on the wire rack. Repeat with remaining bacon and cinnamon roll strips.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cinnamon rolls are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. </li>
        <li>Allow twists to cool for 30 seconds. Drizzle with icing from the cinnamon roll can or use icing as a dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
